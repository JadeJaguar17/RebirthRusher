# Collector
These collectors are meant to "collect" messages and reactions, which lets me
use reactions and messages as certain triggers (for example, prestiging will
reset your timers). Unlike discord.js, Eris doesn't have these built in, so I had
manually import these. I may or may not have just jugged these straight from the
discord.js library (or it may have been a third party library, I honestly don't
remember anymore).
