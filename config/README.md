# Config
These are all JSON files that store configuration info, from Discord IDs to
emoji names to misc resources. Most of these files are meant to be read-only,
with really only `bannedUsers.json` meant to be updated (banning/unbanning
users). These files make it much easier to use and update different resources
without hard-coding them.
